# LitScript Programming Language Definition

LitScript is a programming language that brings the vibe of Gen Z and Hip Hop slang into the world of coding.

## Lit Structure

In LitScript, a program is typically organized into a single class within a single file. This class can host a variety of methods and variables.

## Getting Started

Every LitScript program must include a special method named "main()." This is the entry point of the program, where execution begins.

## What You Can Do

LitScript supports several types of statements and actions:

- **Assignment Statements**: For flexing your variable manipulation skills.
- **Conditional Statements**: Like "if" statements, allowing you to make lit decisions based on conditions.
- **Spin Statements**: Such as "while" loops, perfect for doing things repeatedly under certain lit conditions.
- **Nada Methods**: Special methods that make moves but don't spit any results.

## Calculations

LitScript enables various calculations and logical operations:

- **Mathematical Calculations**: Including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division – you know, the math vibes.
- **Comparisons**: To determine if values are equal, greater, or smaller – keeping it real.
- **Logical Operations**: Utilizing Boolean logic with "AND" and "OR" operators – for some lit logical thinking.
- **Function Calls**: That spit results for further use in the program – making those calls!

## Data Types

LitScript includes a range of data types:

- **Cap/NoCap**: For keeping it real with true or false values.
- **Num**: uhhh this is a number
- **Dub**: uhhh this is also a number, but with a . thingy on it (100.00)

## Data Structures

LitScript simplifies data handling with:

- **Arrays**: A basic structure for storing and managing collections of data – keep your data lit and organized.

## Built-in Tools (Classes/Blueprints)

LitScript provides several built-in classes for common operations:

- **Verse**: For manipulating text, including operations like concatenation, length checking, and more – text magic.
- **InputStream**: Used for reading inputs, such as user keyboard input – keep the conversation flowing.
- **Yell**: For displaying outputs on the screen – let it be seen.

## Additional Features for Future Development

- **Custom Blueprints**: Enabling more complex and user-defined data structures and behaviors – bring your own vibes to the lit party.

## Purpose of LitScript

LitScript is crafted to facilitate the learning of programming fundamentals with a sprinkle of Gen Z and Hip Hop slang. It provides a platform for practicing basic coding skills in Litty  environment. Stay lit and code on!
