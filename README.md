# LitScript Programming Language Definition

LitScript is a programming language designed for ease of learning and use, drawing inspiration from Java.

## File Structure

In LitScript, a program is typically organized into a single class within a single file. This class can host a variety of methods and variables.

## Getting Started

Every LitScript program must include a special method named "main()." This is the entry point of the program, where execution begins.

## What You Can Do

LitScript supports several types of statements and actions:

- **Assignment Statements**: For altering the value of variables.
- **Conditional Statements**: Such as "if" statements, which allow decision-making based on conditions.
- **Loop Statements**: Like "while" loops, for executing code repeatedly under certain conditions.
- **Void Methods**: Special methods that perform actions but do not return any results.

## Calculations

LitScript enables various calculations and logical operations:

- **Mathematical Calculations**: Including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Comparisons**: To determine if values are equal, greater, or smaller.
- **Logical Operations**: Utilizing Boolean logic with "AND" and "OR" operators.
- **Function Calls**: That return results for further use in the program.

## Data Types

LitScript includes a range of data types:

- **boolean**: For true or false values.
- **char**: To represent individual characters, such as letters or symbols.
- **int**: For numerical values, with a size of up to 64 bits.
- **long**: For even larger numerical values, also up to 64 bits.

## Data Structures

LitScript simplifies data handling with:

- **Arrays**: A basic structure for storing and managing collections of data.

## Built-in Tools (Classes)

LitScript provides several built-in classes for common operations:

- **String**: For manipulating text, including operations like concatenation, length checking, and more.
- **InputStream**: Used for reading inputs, such as user keyboard input.
- **PrintStream**: For displaying outputs on the screen.

## Additional Features for Future Development

- **Custom Classes**: Enabling more complex and user-defined data structures and behaviors.

## Purpose of LitScript

LitScript is crafted to facilitate the learning of programming fundamentals and to provide a platform for practicing basic coding skills in a straightforward and intuitive environment.
